# TODO
- Use TOML for metadata
- Use xcursorgen for now
- Write Xcur files later
- Make py project after prototype
- Change project name to "accurse"

# Devil in the details
- Look for svgs (named in assets/theme/metadata.toml) in the assets/theme
	directory recursively. Put them in assets/AC-theme/svgs folder in a
	foldered way. Use this folder to work on future things so as not to
	touch the assets/theme folder again.
- For hycur, just copy the svgs folder to hyprcursors and populate with
	metadata. zip the files and delete the folders inside hyprcursors.
- For xcur, make assets/AC-theme/pngs from svgs. Use xcursorgen afterwards.
