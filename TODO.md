# TODO
- Put ample comments throughout the code, especially for path manipulation.
- Write a python function for recoloring. Do it after the svgs are copied to
	the new location. Use the metadata file for defining new colors.
- Incorporate the rescaling of svgs (based on metadata) in the pipeline.
- Find a way to flip svgs horizontally to make leftie versions.
- Refactor the code and make it a python project.
